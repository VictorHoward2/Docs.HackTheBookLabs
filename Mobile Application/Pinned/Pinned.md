Link Challenge: https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/Pinned/
Description: This app has stored my credentials and I can only login automatically. I tried to intercept the login request and restore my password, but this seems to be a secure connection. Can you help bypass this security restriction and intercept the password in plaintext?
Notice: Install this application in an API Level 29 or earlier (i.e. Android 10.0 (Google APIs)).
